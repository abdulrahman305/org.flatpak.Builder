    <p>
      This package provides a Flatpak copy of Flatpak Builder. This is primarily meant to be used for Flathub
      submissions and infrastructure and as such will follow the requirements of Flathub, but it can be used in
      general as well.

      It also includes several other extra tools such as jq, gh, flat-manager-client, xmlstarlet and flatpak-builder-lint.

      The package is continuously updated and deployed from the master branch of the manifest repository. Please
      refer to the manfiest to check the latest versions of the included components.

      Please refer to the Flathub submission docs on how to use this to build Flatpaks for Flathub.
